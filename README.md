# Scout Grading

Designed to minimise the administration that accompanies running a scout troop. This includes attendance logging, automatically generated patrol grading forms & a smart patrol calculater. Displays data in an easy to read format.

Utilises Google [forms](https://forms.google.com) & [sheets](https://sheets.google.com) to allow for simple, UI based modification and customisation.

Written in Google Apps Script, a JavaScript platform in the cloud.

## Demo

All data is read from the master form as entered below. Upon submission, the necessary data ecosystem is generated by `form-manager.gs`â€”handling additions, removals & edits to the register.

These operations execute concurrently upon submission of the master form:
* Attendance is logged to the associated spreadsheet.
  - If necessary, a row is created for the member.
* Contents of the patrol specific form is generated to reflect the most recent register & the member's attendance.

## Installation

1. Make a copy of each the files within the [scouts-grading](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MN9GEt42tenHOS_lwxHhdEU6lPMXRF7d) G Drive directory.
    - G Drive is able to "Make a copy" of all files in one operation
2. Place the new files in a folder of their own to avoid clutter. (optional)
    - When run, `form-manager.gs` will generate additional forms which are placed in the same folder as the form defined by `masterFormId`. (see below)
